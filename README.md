## 🚀 Projects

- [**Fairseq2**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2) *(Fall 2024)*  
  Contributed to Meta AI’s next-generation sequence modeling toolkit for research and production. Authored [integrity checks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2/pull/840) improving the developer experience.

- [**Cinder**](https://github.com/PeanutButterRat/cinder) *(Spring 2025)*  
  A high-level barebones programming language inspired by Rust. Built a compiler in Python using `llvmlite` to translate abstract syntax trees into LLVM IR for efficient native code generation.

- [**DeepPong**](https://github.com/PeanutButterRat/deeppong) *(Spring 2025)*  
  A deep learning experiment in real-time frame synthesis for Pong. Replaced traditional game rendering with neural networks, testing the feasibility of an AI-driven graphics pipeline.

- [**Hasher**](https://github.com/PeanutButterRat/hasher) *(Summer 2024)*  
  A lightweight, command-line hashing tool written in Rust. Supports SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, aimed at educational use and understanding of cryptographic hash functions.

- [**Fumble**](https://github.com/PeanutButterRat/fumble) *(Fall 2023)*  
  A full-stack group chat application built with Flask, Socket.IO, and SQLite. Designed for real-time messaging with user authentication and deployment on AWS.
